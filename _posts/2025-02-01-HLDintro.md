Welcome to Homelab Dad

Check out my first youtube video here where I dive into why I'm starting this hobby, or just keep reading! 

âœ¨ Goals:

Learn Stuff: Dive deep into new technologies and hands-on experimentation.
Have Fun: Because tech is awesome, and this is my way to geek out.
Teach My Son: Share knowledge and inspire curiosity in the next generation.
Take Control of My Digital Footprint: Gain more control over my data and improve security/privacy.
